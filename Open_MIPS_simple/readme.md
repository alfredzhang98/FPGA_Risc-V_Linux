This is the basic structure of MIPS softcore, which can only realize the instruction of "ori". 

The soft uses 5-pipline stage, which are instruction fetch, instruction decode, excution, Memory access and Write back.

The project is used in vcs and verdi. You can also copy the rtl and tb and mem file in sim dir into modelsim for simulation
